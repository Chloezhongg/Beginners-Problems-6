###1. Is it a Triangle?

def triangleTest(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides to identify the largest side
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check if the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side
    return sides[0] + sides[1] > sides[2]

# Example usage:
side1 = float(input("Enter the first side: "))
side2 = float(input("Enter the second side: "))
side3 = float(input("Enter the third side: "))

if triangleTest(side1, side2, side3):
    print("It is a triangle.")
else:
    print("It is not a triangle.")

###2. Greetings
Here's a program with three subroutines for greetings based on the time of day:

def good_morning(name):
    print(f"Good morning, {name}!")

def good_afternoon(name):
    print(f"Good afternoon, {name}!")

def good_evening(name):
    print(f"Good evening, {name}!")

def greet_user():
    name = input("Whatâ€™s your name: ").strip()
    time = int(input("What time is it (0-23): ").strip())

    if 0 <= time <= 12:
        good_morning(name)
    elif 13 <= time <= 17:
        good_afternoon(name)
    elif 18 <= time <= 23:
        good_evening(name)
    else:
        print("Invalid time entered.")

###3. Even Numbers

def getEven(numbers):
    even_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(num)
    return even_numbers

# Example usage:
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = getEven(numbers_list)
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
